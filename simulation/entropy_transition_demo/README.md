# Cognitive Entropy vs. Landauer Bound (Demo)

This folder contains a self-contained script and resulting plot used in the main paper (Figure N).  
It demonstrates the step-like behavior of cognitive entropy as a function of perceptual resolution Îµ, 
compared with the Landauer limit (energy cost per bit).

- `cognitive_entropy_vs_landauer.py` generates the plot.
- `cognitive_entropy_vs_landauer.pdf` is the output included in the manuscript.

No external files are required to run the script. Only `matplotlib` and `numpy` are needed.
